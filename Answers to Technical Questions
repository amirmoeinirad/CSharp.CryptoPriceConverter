1. I spent nearly two days. If I had more time, I would design a beautiful UI using CSS, I would implement EF Core and SQL Server to store the results based on time and date in a database.


2. The Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation feature .NET 9.
In the .csproj file:
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
   <PropertyGroup>
      <PublishAot>true</PublishAot>
   </PropertyGroup>
</Project>

Then in the project path:
> dotnet publish -c Release

3. I would use tools like Performance Profiler in Visual Studio to analyze my code or use Execution Plan tool in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to optimize my query. If the query were already optimized, I would use caching options like IMemoryCach or Redis.

4. 'Advanced C# Programming' by Paul Kimmel. I learned about Reflection in .NET.

5. I think this assignment was a good practice for me. I reviewed several concepts regarding MVC model once again especially sending data from controllers to the views. In addition, I learned how to serialize/deserialize and parse JSON.

6. JSON
